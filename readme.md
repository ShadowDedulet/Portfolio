# Portfolio project

This portfolio is a project - website with list of my other projects, authentication, duo-language support (`eng`, `rus`).

## When I started?

I started this project at January 30, 2022.

## What am I using?

-   Code is written in `TypeScript` then rendered to `JavaScript` for browser support (mb change later).
-   For server I use `Node.js`, `Express`.
-   View engine is `ejs`.
-   User's data stored in `MongoDB`.
-   For date I use `date-and-time` npm package.
